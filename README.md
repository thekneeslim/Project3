# GA Launch Pad

As it stands, General Assembly only has a database of student alumni available for public viewing. Viewers are not able to filter students according to batches nor sift them out through Meet & Greet sessions. Hence, my team decided to create an app to address this gap.

Built on:
  - Rails 5
  - Full stack
  
Functionality:
  - User validation
  - User live/authorisation status 
  - User input of information/giphys
  - AJAX
  - Administrator rights

Live Site: http://ga-launchpad.herokuapp.com
